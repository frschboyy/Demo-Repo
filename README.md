# Glaucoma Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to detect glaucoma using Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness (RNFLT) images obtained from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans. The goal is to enhance early detection of glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, by leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Problem Statement
Glaucoma is a serious eye condition that often remains asymptomatic until advanced stages, leading to irreversible vision loss. The current diagnostic methods are costly and labor-intensive, making regular check-ups challenging, especially in regions with limited healthcare resources. This project aims to address these challenges by utilizing deep learning to analyze RNFLT images and improve the accuracy and efficiency of glaucoma detection.

## Dataset
Source: Harvard Medical School
Content: 500 labeled RNFLT images from unique patients, with and without glaucoma.
Preprocessing: Includes artifact removal, inpainting, 3D mapping, image augmentation, and batch processing to ensure high-quality data for model training.

## Model Overview
We leveraged a Convolutional Neural Network design for binary classification.

## Potential Impact
Strides in deep learning could significantly enhance healthcare in Africa by improving early  detection of disease, reducing costs associated with disease progression, and addressing disparities in healthcare access.
